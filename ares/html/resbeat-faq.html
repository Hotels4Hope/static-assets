<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>
    <strong>How do I know that my reservation is confirmed with the property?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You will receive an instant confirmation to your email address immediately following your reservation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How can I be sure my credit card information is secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use secure-socket-layer (SSL) encryption, the standard encryption on the Internet. This encryption allows our users to feel confident and secure about supplying their credit
    card and personal information. SSL provides assurance that you are really doing business with us (and not an impostor) and that the information you are sending to us can not be
    intercepted or decrypted by anyone other than the intended recipient.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What does instant confirmation mean?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have provided you an actual reservation with an instant booking number, so there is nothing else that needs to be done. Behind the scenes we ask the provider to re-validate
    the reservation and acknowledge they are prepared for your arrival.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Can I book a room for tonight?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some hotels allow us to book their rooms until 3:00pm on the day of arrival. Only those hotels that follow this policy will be displayed to you if your arrival date is the same
    day.

    The hotel information is actually updated by the hotel or hotel chain a number of times per year. Additionally, we strive to have the most accurate and complete hotel
    information available but we have to rely on the personnel at the hotel property to update and change information when appropriate. If you have specific requirements we
    recommend you contact the hotel to validate the amenity or service(s).

<p>
    <strong>What are additional fees and taxes?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Every city has their own tax rates. In some cases there are additional fees imposed by providers, local, city, state and federal agencies. Taxes are computed on the hotel
    reservation amount and fees charged as predicated by the provider. Non-refundable deposits are periodically required to hold rooms for your arrival and to provide you the
    lowest rates.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is this charge on my credit card?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Non-refundable deposits are periodically required to hold rooms for your arrival and to provide you the lowest rates.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do you include taxes in the total rate?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Generally yes, we do provide rates and breakout the taxes for your convenience; however, occasionally a hotel will not provide us with their tax information and therefore we
    are unable to show that information to you. If you find a hotel that doesn't provide tax rate information, please call us and we'll find out the tax information for you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do I pay for the entire reservation amount or do I just make a deposit to hold the room?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It depends on what we have negotiated with the provider. Some of our providers require just a room night deposit to hold your room while others require pre-payment at the time
    of your reservation. Please refer to the amount displayed on the hotel confirmation page to see what your credit card will be charged upon making the reservation. Typically
    those requiring pre-payment are offering significantly reduced rates.
</p>
