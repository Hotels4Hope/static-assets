    <p><strong>How do I know that my reservation is confirmed with the property?</strong><br>You will receive an instant confirmation to your email address immediately following your reservation.</p>
    <p><strong>How can I be sure my credit card information is secure?</strong><br>We use secure-socket-layer (SSL) encryption, the standard encryption on the Internet. This encryption allows our users to feel confident and secure about supplying their credit card and personal information. SSL provides assurance that you are really doing business with us (and not an impostor) and that the information you are sending to us can not be intercepted or decrypted by anyone other than the intended recipient.</p>
    <p><strong>What does instant confirmation mean?</strong><br>We have provided you an actual reservation with an instant confirmation number, so there is nothing else that needs to be done.
